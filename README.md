# Opinion Rewards for Restaurant Surveys

## Web Application for Restaurants. The application spans both the business and user ends. 

* Business: Allows businesses to get user specific as well as generic reviews given by customers. Customers get an incentive to give reviews and businesses can analyse the data from the reviews to improve their service and grow their business. Restaurants can also send discount coupons to their users for any special occasions such as christmas, new year, birthdays etc.    
* User: It provides users with the reviews and ratings of restaurants. The main feature in this end is the user survey and credit section, where the user can fill a survey for each restaurant visit and accumulate credits. These credits can be redeemed by the user in the form of money. Users can also refer restaurants to friends and obtain credits.
